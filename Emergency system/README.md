The project is an emergency system for buildings requiring critical emergency systems such as hospitals and companies.
When the start button is pressed or in the event of an emergency, a 10-second countdown begins. 
During this time, the first emergency light illuminates. However, the doors remain open for this duration to allow people to exit the building.
Then, at the tenth second, the second emergency light turns on for another 10 seconds, and the doors are kept open. In the final 10 seconds,
the doors close, the alarm is activated, and all emergency lights illuminate.
The doors close in the last 10 seconds to prevent adjacent structures from being affected or any other damage around the building.
